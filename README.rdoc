== Sample Backbone App using Backbone-relational

This is a sample Backbone app that uses a Rails backend, the rails-backbone gem for
integrating Backbone, and the Backbone-relational lib to maintain relations in 
Backbone. Slightly inspired by the example Todo app in the Backbone docs.
You can find a working demo here http://rails-backbone-relational.herokuapp.com/posts
This demo uses a localStorage adapter and doesn't actually store anything on the DB
